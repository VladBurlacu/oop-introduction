/* EXERCISE 1
TODO: Create a class beverage.
TODO: Create the properties color (string), price (float) and temperature (string) and also foresee a construct.
TODO: Have a default value "cold" in the construct for temperature.

Remember for now we will use properties and methods that can be accessed from everywhere.
TODO: Make a getInfo function which returns "This beverage is
<temperature> and
    <color>."
        TODO: Instantiate an object which represents cola. Make sure that the color is set to black, the price equals 2
        euro and the temperature to cold automatically
        print the getInfo on the screen.
        TODO: Print the temperature on the screen.
